# Cool-Graphics-Stuffs-In-C
This project has some C programs for cool graphics animations that uses inbuilt C library for rendering animations on the screen.
This project is completely based on C Language and uses "graphics.h" library of in-built C libraries. 
This project is developed in Codeblocks IDE for C language. For other IDE's some changes are needed to be made to the code.
To run the file in Codeblocks, you need to create a project. After the project is created, right click on the project name in the Project window on the left hand side of the window. Then select Add File option and then select the file you want to run and then run the file.
In case you get some problem in running a file, make sure to rebuild the project. Also also there should only be one file in the project, so only keep file that you want to run. Remove all the other files from project by right clicking on the files you want to remove in the same project window.
